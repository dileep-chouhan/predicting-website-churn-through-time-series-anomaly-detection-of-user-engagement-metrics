# Predicting Website Churn Through Time Series Anomaly Detection of User Engagement Metrics

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting website churn by analyzing time series data of user engagement metrics.  We employ anomaly detection techniques to identify periods of significant decline in user engagement, allowing for proactive interventions to mitigate churn and improve user retention. The analysis involves exploring various time series models and anomaly detection algorithms to pinpoint critical trends and deviations from expected user behavior.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (potentially, depending on the chosen anomaly detection algorithm)
* Statsmodels (potentially, depending on the chosen time series model)


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.  Then, install the required Python libraries listed above using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This script will perform the time series analysis and anomaly detection.  You may need to adjust file paths within `main.py` to point to your data source.


## Example Output

The script will print key findings of the analysis to the console, including summary statistics and details about detected anomalies.  Additionally, it will generate several plot files visualizing the time series data, trends, and detected anomalies (e.g., `engagement_trend.png`, `anomaly_detection.png`). These plots provide a visual representation of user engagement patterns and highlight periods of significant decline that warrant attention.  The specific output files and their contents will depend on the implemented analysis techniques.
